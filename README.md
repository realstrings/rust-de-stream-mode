# rust-de-stream-mode
Simple script to calculate streamer mode name from steam id.

Function dumped from game code, also file dumped from game files.

You can simply dump steam ids from rust server by using battlemetrics with steam api, then calculate all names using this script.

Now you have few names, servers your targets are on.

Happy hunting.
